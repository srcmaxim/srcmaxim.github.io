      <description>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.
The SDLC includes ten phases during which defined IT work products are created or modified. The tenth phase occurs when the system is disposed of and the task performed is either eliminated or transferred to other systems.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go. It builds pages in under a second. And there are no dependencies to install. It seems like a good idea to use it as a base for a site.
I tryed to use Jekyll, but I have some issues with it. Using Jekyll isn&amp;rsquo;t staringht forward, you need to install Ruby and Gem plugins and enshure right versioning. Themes for a site should be right versioned too.</description>
