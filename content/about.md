I’m Maksym Koval.

I love mastery. Sometimes it’s mastery of an athletic pursuit, others times it’s understanding of history or scientific principles. Complex systems entertain me. Simple solutions inspire me. 

Any given weekend you might find me running a half marathon, reading a treatise on ETOPS, hiking a remote Norwegian fjord, racing a half marathon, or drafting a meetup presentation.

Drop me a line if you’re a like minded soul.
