Hi! Iâ€™m Maksym Koval. I work as a Java Developer in Kharkiv, Ukraine :ukraine:.
 
I'm inspired by todays technologies and I want to share my thoughts with you.  
Also I like doing sports. On weekends you can find me running and biking around city.  

All code examples and other projects you can find here in my [GitHub](https://github.com/srcmaxim/).
